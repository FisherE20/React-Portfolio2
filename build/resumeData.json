    "bio": "Hello, I reside in Tucson, AZ with the loving and supportive husband Michael. I'm origanally from Rohnert Park, CA where I grew up with my 2 younger sisters and a younger brother. In my free time I enjoy cooking, baking, doing crafts (making wreaths) and hanging out with family and friends. I'm also a huge movie and music fan. I have worked in the dental field for the last 19 years and decided it was time for a career change. I decided to go into web development/coding because in highschool I took a semester of web design and really enjoyed myself. My dream job would be to work somewhere that both challenges me and allows me to be creative..",
